# NBA Team Clustering Mini-Project  

**Project Motivation**: The league has changed significantly in the past decade. Which team has the best outlook? What team needs to improve in which categories?  

1. Data  
Webscraped data of boxscores from [NBA Stats Link](https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/boxscores/) and season summaries from [basketball-reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2019.html) between the years of 2014-2019 to explore the differences between teams.
