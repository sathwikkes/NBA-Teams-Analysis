# NBA Team Clustering Mini-Project  
(in progress)
### Project Motivation   
The NBA has seen massive changes to both the association and teams around the league in the past decade.  
For example, just to name a few:  
1. Association  
    - gamestyle  
    - fouls favoring shooters
    - players' rights being voiced
    - playoff structure (2-3-2 to 2-2-1-1-1)
    - Travelling Rule w/ Zero Step
    - Reviews  
  
2. League     
    - James Harden to Houston   
    - Kawhi Leonard to Raptors  
    - Lebron James to Lakers  
    - Chris Paul to Clippers     

With so much going on, franchises are trying their best to bring home the Larry O'Brien trophy by buidling their teams with key personnel. 

Which team has the best outlook? What team needs changes to be made and to which categories?  

### Problem Statement  
Team _ has had a losing record for back to back years
